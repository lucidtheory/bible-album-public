const copy = 'This Bible Album was built over the course of two years, between 2021 and 2022.\n\nUsing the New Heart English Edition of the Bible, which is in the public domain, 25 inspiring verses were hand picked from each of the 66 books of the Holy Bible and are presented here in order of their appearance. For books that have less than 25 verses, all the verses of that book are used.\n\nAfter searching for great verses, the inspiration behind this project was to pair the Word of God in text, with images of the Word of God Breathed, creation. For each of the verses collected, a unique high definition image of creation, nature, was hand picked to be a part of this project. The rights to use the images have all been acquired for this project.\n\nThe vision is for the Bible Album to be translated into multiple languages. French, Spanish, Arabic, and more. Also, to be able to have physical versions published in various languages.\n\nThe focus, dedication, diligence, and attention to detail to create this work were done solely for the purpose of inspiring. May this work be an inspiration through hard times, through good times, through all times that the Lord our God is good, and that those who believe in Him are covered under his wing.\n\nAnd all Godâ€™s people said,\nAmen';
